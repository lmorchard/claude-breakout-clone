I want to execute the plan for the current dev session.

We should have a plan.md and spec.md for the current dev session. Confirm that we have these files.

Read the plan.md and spec.md files and decide whether the plan is detailed and ready for implementation. If not, ask me to provide more details.

If the plan is detailed and ready for implementation, execute the plan.

While executing the plan, you MUST update the todo.md file as you go to reflect the progress of the plan. This is in addition - but not a replacement for - your usage of TodoRead and TodoWrite tools.

After each phase or major batch of changes, please commit to git with a message summarizing the phase. Do not push to remote, yet. I will review changes in git when the plan is done.
