# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Breakout clone game project. The repository is currently in early development stages.

## Development Sessions

This project uses organized development sessions documented in `docs/dev-sessions/` directories. Each session follows the pattern:
- `docs/dev-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{slug}/`
- Contains: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `todo.md`, `notes.md`

When starting a new development session, create the appropriate session directory structure and documentation files.

## Architecture Notes

This section will be expanded as the project architecture emerges during development.

## Common Commands

This section will be populated once build tools and testing frameworks are established.
