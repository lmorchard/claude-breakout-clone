# Session Plan: Initial Setup

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
1. **Initialize Vite + TypeScript project**
   - Create package.json with Vite and TypeScript setup
   - Install Phaser.js as core dependency
   - Configure TypeScript for strict mode
   - Set up basic Vite config for development

2. **Create project structure**
   - `/src` - main source code
   - `/src/scenes` - Phaser game scenes
   - `/src/objects` - game object classes
   - `/src/config` - configuration constants
   - `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
   - `/public` - static assets
   - Basic HTML entry point

3. **Configure development environment**
   - Verify Vite dev server runs
   - Test hot reload functionality
   - Set up basic Phaser game instance

### Phase 2: Core Game Architecture
4. **Create configuration system**
   - Central GameConfig object with all tunable parameters
   - Ball, paddle, brick dimensions and physics constants
   - UI positioning and spacing values
   - Game flow timing parameters

5. **Implement responsive scaling system**
   - Fixed internal game resolution (768x1024)
   - Automatic scaling to fit browser window
   - Maintain aspect ratio and game coordinate consistency

6. **Set up basic Phaser scenes**
   - StartScene - main menu
   - GameScene - core gameplay
   - GameOverScene - end game states
   - Scene transitions and state management

### Phase 3: Core Game Objects
7. **Create Ball class**
   - 20x20 circle with physics body
   - 250px/second movement with configurable speed
   - Bounce physics with angle variation based on collision point

8. **Create Paddle class**
   - 100x25 rectangle positioned 50px from bottom
   - Mouse-controlled 1:1 movement
   - Collision detection with variable bounce angles

9. **Create Brick class and grid system**
   - Individual 100x25 brick objects
   - Grid generation: 7 rows with 10px spacing
   - Destruction mechanics and collision handling

### Phase 4: Game Systems
10. **Implement collision detection**
    - Ball-paddle collisions with angle variation
    - Ball-brick collisions with destruction
    - Ball-wall bounces (sides and top)
    - Bottom boundary detection (life loss)

11. **Add game state management**
    - Lives system (3 lives total)
    - Score tracking (1 point per brick)
    - Win/lose conditions
    - Ball respawn with "ready" prompt

12. **Create UI system**
    - Status bar with score, lives, pause button
    - Start screen with play button
    - Game over screen with restart option
    - Victory screen with restart option

### Phase 5: Polish and Testing
13. **Implement pause functionality**
    - Pause/resume game state
    - Pause button in UI
    - Visual feedback for paused state

14. **Test and refine**
    - Verify all game mechanics work correctly
    - Test responsive scaling across different screen sizes
    - Adjust physics and gameplay feel as needed
    - Ensure all success criteria are met

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Patterns
- **Scene-based architecture**: Separate Phaser scenes for different game states
- **Component-based objects**: Reusable classes for game entities
- **Configuration-driven**: Central config object for easy parameter tuning
- **Event-driven communication**: Phaser events for loose coupling between systems

### Key Technologies
- **Phaser 3.70+**: Latest stable version for game engine
- **Vite 5.x**: Modern build tool with fast HMR
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Strict typing for better code quality
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system

### Development Strategy
- Incremental development with working game at each phase
- Configuration-first approach for easy iteration
- Test core mechanics early before adding polish
- Commit after each major phase for rollback safety

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- `phaser`: ^3.70.0 (game engine)

### Development Dependencies
- `vite`: ^5.0.0 (build tool and dev server)
- `typescript`: ^5.0.0 (TypeScript compiler)
- `@types/node`: Latest (Node.js type definitions)

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Canvas and WebGL support
- Mouse input support

## Risks and Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Physics complexity**: Ball-paddle angle variation may need fine-tuning
- **Performance**: Collision detection with many bricks could impact framerate
- **Responsive scaling**: Ensuring consistent gameplay across different screen sizes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple physics, iterate based on feel
- Use Phaser's built-in physics optimizations
- Test scaling early and often during development
- Keep configuration flexible for rapid iteration

### Scope Management
- Focus on core mechanics before polish
- Defer advanced features (powerups, levels) to future sessions
- Prioritize working game over perfect code initially
