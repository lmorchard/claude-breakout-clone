# Session Notes: Initial Setup

## Progress Log

Session started: 2025-07-05 10:57
Session completed: All 5 phases successfully implemented

## Technical Decisions

1. **Architecture**: Used scene-based Phaser architecture with separate game object classes
2. **Configuration**: Centralized all tunable parameters in GameConfig.ts for easy iteration
3. **Physics**: Used Phaser's Arcade physics with custom bounce logic for paddle interaction
4. **Input**: Implemented 1:1 mouse movement for paddle control with proper coordinate conversion
5. **Scaling**: Used Phaser.Scale.FIT mode with min/max constraints for responsive gameplay
6. **State Management**: Built-in game state tracking with proper scene transitions

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed physics body type casting issues with proper Arcade.Body types
2. **Coordinate Conversion**: Handled mouse coordinate conversion for responsive scaling
3. **Ball Physics**: Implemented speed consistency checking to prevent ball from slowing down
4. **Collision Detection**: Used simplified collision side detection for brick bouncing
5. **Game Flow**: Added ready prompts and proper ball respawn mechanics

## Implementation Highlights

- Complete working Breakout game with all specified features
- Responsive design that scales properly across screen sizes
- Physics-based ball movement with realistic paddle bouncing
- Automatic brick grid generation with configurable parameters
- Full game state management (lives, score, win/lose conditions)
- Polished UI with pause functionality and scene transitions

## Session Summary

Successfully completed all planned phases:
1. ✅ Project foundation (Vite + TypeScript + Phaser setup)
2. ✅ Core architecture (scenes, config, responsive scaling)  
3. ✅ Game objects (Ball, Paddle, Brick classes)
4. ✅ Game systems (collisions, state management, UI)
5. ✅ Polish (pause, testing, refinement)

The game is fully functional and ready for gameplay testing. All success criteria from the spec have been met. The codebase provides a solid foundation for future enhancements like powerups, levels, or advanced physics.
