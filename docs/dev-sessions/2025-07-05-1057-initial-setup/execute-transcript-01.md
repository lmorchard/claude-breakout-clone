        90 +  
        91    ## Technical Approach
        92    
        93 -  TBD - to be defined based on requirements
        93 +  ### Architecture Patterns
        94 +  - **Scene-based architecture**: Separate Phaser scenes for different game states
        95 +  - **Component-based objects**: Reusable classes for game entities
        96 +  - **Configuration-driven**: Central config object for easy parameter tuning
        97 +  - **Event-driven communication**: Phaser events for loose coupling between systems
        98    
        99 +  ### Key Technologies
       100 +  - **Phaser 3.70+**: Latest stable version for game engine
       101 +  - **Vite 5.x**: Modern build tool with fast HMR
       102 +  - **TypeScript 5.x**: Strict typing for better code quality
       103 +  - **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system
       104 +  
       105 +  ### Development Strategy
       106 +  - Incremental development with working game at each phase
       107 +  - Configuration-first approach for easy iteration
       108 +  - Test core mechanics early before adding polish
       109 +  - Commit after each major phase for rollback safety
       110 +  
       111    ## Dependencies
       112    
       113 -  TBD - to be identified during planning
       113 +  ### Runtime Dependencies
       114 +  - `phaser`: ^3.70.0 (game engine)
       115    
       116 +  ### Development Dependencies
       117 +  - `vite`: ^5.0.0 (build tool and dev server)
       118 +  - `typescript`: ^5.0.0 (TypeScript compiler)
       119 +  - `@types/node`: Latest (Node.js type definitions)
       120 +  
       121 +  ### Browser Requirements
       122 +  - Modern browsers with ES6 support
       123 +  - Canvas and WebGL support
       124 +  - Mouse input support
       125 +  
       126    ## Risks and Considerations
       127    
       128 -  TBD - to be assessed during planning
       128   \ No newline at end of file
       129 +  ### Technical Risks
       130 +  - **Physics complexity**: Ball-paddle angle variation may need fine-tuning
       131 +  - **Performance**: Collision detection with many bricks could impact framerate
       132 +  - **Responsive scaling**: Ensuring consistent gameplay across different screen sizes
       133 +  
       134 +  ### Mitigation Strategies
       135 +  - Start with simple physics, iterate based on feel
       136 +  - Use Phaser's built-in physics optimizations
       137 +  - Test scaling early and often during development
       138 +  - Keep configuration flexible for rapid iteration
       139 +  
       140 +  ### Scope Management
       141 +  - Focus on core mechanics before polish
       142 +  - Defer advanced features (powerups, levels) to future sessions
       143 +  - Prioritize working game over perfect code initially
