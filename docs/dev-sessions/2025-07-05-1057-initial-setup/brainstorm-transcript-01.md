● I can see the spec has been updated with a great overview of the Breakout game concept using Phaser, Vite, and TypeScript. Let me read the current spec to understand what's already defined:

● Read(docs/dev-sessions/2025-07-05-1057-initial-setup/spec.md)
  ⎿  Read 32 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I can see you've laid out a solid foundation for the Breakout game concept. Now let's dig into the specifics to create a detailed spec. I'll start with the first question:

  What should be the target game screen dimensions (width x height in pixels), and do you want the game to be responsive or have a fixed canvas size?

  This will help determine the layout calculations for the brick grid, paddle positioning, and overall game scaling.

> Good question. We want it to be responsive. We'd like the playfield to be taller than wide, maybe 3:4. For game purposes, let's say the initial resolution is 768 x 1024. But, let's decouple the internal game resoultion from the browser resolution - we'll
   want the game to scale up to fill the browser window while keeping the gamefield coordinates consistent

● Excellent! That separation of concerns between game resolution and display resolution is smart for consistent gameplay.

  For the brick grid at the top - you mentioned 7 rows and filling the screen width. What should be the spacing between individual bricks, and how much padding/margin should there be between the brick grid and the edges of the game field?

  This will help define the exact brick layout calculations and ensure the grid looks balanced within the 768-pixel wide game field.

> Let's say the ball is a 20x20 circle. The spacing between bricks should be aesthetically pleasing but not wide enough to allow the ball to pass - maybe 10px spacing between bricks and the edges of the screen.

● Good specifications! The 10px spacing will ensure tight gameplay while looking clean.

  What should be the dimensions of individual bricks? Should they be rectangular (and if so, what width x height), and do you want all bricks to be the same size, or should there be variation in the grid layout?

  This will help determine how many bricks fit across the 768px width with your 10px spacing, and whether we need different brick types or a uniform grid.

> All these spacing and sizing metrics should be configurable constants, too, by the way. The bricks should be rectangular - say 4:1 ratio of width to height. Let's see if 100x25 bricks work for now? Let's keep the bricks the same size for now

● Perfect! I'll note the configuration requirement - very wise for tweaking gameplay later.

  With 100x25 bricks and 10px spacing, that gives us about 6-7 bricks per row (768 - 20 for margins = 748, divided by 110 per brick slot).

  For the player paddle - what dimensions should it have (width x height), and how far from the bottom edge of the game field should it be positioned? Also, should the paddle movement be 1:1 with mouse movement, or do you want some kind of speed multiplier
   or smoothing?

  This affects both collision detection and the feel of player control.

> Paddle movement should be 1:1 with the mouse for now. Paddle dimensions, let's say 100x25 for now like the bricks, but we'll want to tune that as a configurable property - maybe even mid-game if we implement powerups. And let's say 50px from bottom of 
  the playfield.

● Great! The paddle matching brick dimensions initially makes sense for consistent collision detection.

  For the ball physics - what should be the initial ball speed (pixels per frame or pixels per second), and when the ball bounces off the paddle, do you want the bounce angle to be influenced by where on the paddle it hits? For example, hitting the center 
  bounces straight up, while hitting the edges creates more angled bounces?

  This is crucial for gameplay feel - realistic physics vs. more arcade-style predictable bounces.

> Yeah, let's try to vary the bounce angle based on where the ball hits on both paddle and bricks. We'll need to tune this for game-feel. Initially, let's say 250px-per-second movement - we'll also need to tune this as a parameter. In fact, we probably 
  want to collect parameters like this in one big data structure that influences the feel of the entire level

● Excellent point about the centralized game parameters! That'll make balancing much easier.

  For the scoring and progression system - you mentioned 1 point per brick destroyed. Do you want different colored bricks in different rows to have different point values (like classic Breakout), or should we keep it simple with uniform scoring for now? 
  Also, should the ball speed increase as the game progresses, or should it remain constant throughout a level?

  This affects both the challenge curve and the visual design of the brick grid.

> Let's keep it simple for now - we will want to vary brick color and point values in the near future, but let's just get the basics working first. Keep ball speed constant for now, defer speed change to a future iteration.

● Perfect! Keeping it simple first is the right approach.

  For the game state management and user interface - besides the score display, what other UI elements do you want visible during gameplay? For example: remaining lives counter, pause button, current level indicator? And where should these be positioned on
   the screen?

  This will help define the complete game layout and what needs to be implemented for the initial version.

> Let's position score display, remaining lives, and a pause button at the top of the screen. Maybe add a status bar margin at the top above the brick wall

● Great! A status bar keeps the UI organized and separate from the gameplay area.

  For the game states and flow - when the game starts, do you want it to immediately begin gameplay, or should there be a start screen/menu first? Also, when a player loses a life, should the ball restart immediately, or do you want a brief pause with some
   kind of "ready" prompt before the ball launches again?

  This affects both the initial user experience and the pacing during gameplay when lives are lost.

> Let's implement a simple start menu and a brief pause with a "ready" prompt before the ball launches again

● Excellent! That adds good polish to the user experience.

  Final question: For the collision detection system - do you want pixel-perfect collision detection, or would simple rectangular bounding box collision be sufficient for this initial version? Also, when the ball hits a brick edge vs. face, should it 
  behave differently (like bouncing off the side vs. top/bottom), or keep it simple with consistent bounce behavior?

  This will determine the complexity of the physics implementation and how realistic vs. arcade-like the gameplay feels.

> I think initially, let's just go for rectangular collisions - we can enhance that later. When the ball hits an edge vs face, it should indeed behave differently. It should bounce off the surface approximately like real physics in order to intuitively 
  feel right

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to create a comprehensive spec. Let me summarize what we've covered:

  1. Target resolution: 768x1024 (3:4 ratio), responsive scaling while keeping game coordinates consistent
  2. Ball: 20x20 circle, 250px/second speed initially
  3. Bricks: 100x25 rectangular, 10px spacing, uniform grid for now, 7 rows
  4. Paddle: 100x25, 50px from bottom, 1:1 mouse movement
  5. Physics: Variable bounce angles based on hit location, realistic edge vs face collision behavior
  6. Scoring: 1 point per brick, uniform for now
  7. UI: Score, lives, pause button in status bar at top
  8. Game flow: Start menu, brief pause/"ready" prompt when respawning
  9. Collision: Rectangular bounding boxes initially, different behavior for edge vs face hits
  10. All parameters should be configurable in a central data structure

  Now I should update the spec.md file with all these details.

● Perfect! That gives us a solid foundation with room to enhance the physics later.

  I now have all the details needed for a comprehensive spec. Let me update the spec.md file with everything we've discussed:
