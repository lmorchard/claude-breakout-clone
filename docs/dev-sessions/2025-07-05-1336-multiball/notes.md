# Multiball Feature Development Notes

## Session: 2025-07-05-1336-multiball

### Session Start
- Started multiball development session
- Created session directory structure
- Developed comprehensive spec and implementation plan

### Development Notes

#### Phase 1: Configuration Setup
- Added powerup configuration properties to GameConfig.ts
- POWERUP_SPAWN_CHANCE: 0.1 (10% chance)
- POWERUP_FALL_SPEED: 100 px/s
- BALL_SPAWN_OFFSET: 30px
- POWERUP color: light green (0x90EE90)

#### Phase 2: Multiple Ball Support
- Successfully converted single ball system to ball array
- Implemented addBall(), removeBall(), getBallCount() methods
- Added ball-to-ball collision physics using elastic collision (velocity swap)
- Modified game logic so lives are only lost when ALL balls are gone
- Each ball maintains independent physics and collision behavior

#### Phase 3: Powerup System Infrastructure
- Created base Powerup class extending Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite
- Implemented MultiballPowerup subclass with ball icon
- Added powerup management to GameScene with physics group
- Setup powerup-paddle collision detection
- Powerups automatically fall at constant speed and cleanup when off-screen

#### Phase 4: Powerup Spawning
- Integrated 10% probability powerup spawning with brick destruction
- Powerups spawn at exact brick position
- Works with any cause of brick destruction

#### Phase 5: Multiball Behavior
- Implemented multiball activation logic: doubles ball count
- New balls spawn with inverted X velocity, same Y velocity
- Added boundary checking and random Y offset for spawned balls
- Ensures balls don't spawn outside game area or overlap exactly

#### Phase 6: Testing & Polish
- Added debug key 'M' to spawn multiball powerups for testing
- Added ball count display to UI
- Fixed powerup visual graphics positioning
- Real-time ball count updates

### Technical Insights
- Phaser collision system works well with dynamic ball arrays
- Graphics positioning needs to be relative to sprite, not absolute coordinates
- Ball-to-ball collisions use simple velocity swap for predictable behavior
- Powerup spawning probability is easily tunable through configuration

### Final Summary
Successfully implemented complete multiball feature with:
- ✅ Multiple ball support (unlimited count)
- ✅ Powerup system with falling mechanics
- ✅ 10% chance powerup spawning from brick destruction
- ✅ Multiball powerup that doubles ball count
- ✅ Ball-to-ball collision physics
- ✅ Lives lost only when all balls are gone
- ✅ Debug helpers for testing
- ✅ Proper boundary checking and collision management

The feature is ready for production use and easily extensible for additional powerup types.
