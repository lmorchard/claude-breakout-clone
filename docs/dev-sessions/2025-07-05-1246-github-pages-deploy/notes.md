# Session Notes: GitHub Pages Deployment

## Progress Log

Session started: 2025-07-05 12:46
Phase 1 completed: 2025-07-05 12:50
Phase 2 completed: 2025-07-05 12:52
Changes committed: e8c02e3

## Technical Decisions

1. **Environment-based Base Path**: Used `process.env.NODE_ENV` to conditionally set base path in Vite config
   - Development: `base: '/'` for local development
   - Production: `base: '/claude-breakout-clone/'` for GitHub Pages subdirectory
   
2. **Modern GitHub Actions Deployment**: Used the latest GitHub Actions deployment method
   - No gh-pages branch needed
   - Direct deployment to GitHub Pages
   - Proper permissions and environment configuration

3. **Workflow Triggers**: Configured for automatic deployment on main branch pushes
   - Also supports manual workflow_dispatch for testing

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Base Path Configuration**: Initially needed to determine the correct environment variable approach
   - Solution: Used NODE_ENV check for production builds
   - Verified by testing local build and checking generated HTML

2. **GitHub Actions Setup**: Needed latest actions and proper permissions
   - Solution: Used actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, and actions/deploy-pages@v4
   - Set proper permissions for pages deployment

## Implementation Highlights

- Successfully updated Vite configuration for environment-based base paths
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow with proper caching
- Verified production build generates correct asset paths
- Used latest GitHub Actions deployment method (no gh-pages branch required)
- All changes committed and ready for deployment

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Merge to main branch**: The workflow triggers on pushes to main branch
2. **Push to remote**: This will trigger the GitHub Actions deployment
3. **Verify deployment**: Check https://lmorchard.github.io/claude-breakout-clone/
4. **Test game functionality**: Ensure all features work in hosted environment

## Session Summary

Successfully completed GitHub Pages deployment setup:
- âœ… Phase 1: Vite configuration with environment-based base paths
- âœ… Phase 2: GitHub Actions workflow creation and configuration
- âœ… Commit: All changes committed (e8c02e3)
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for: Merge to main and push to trigger deployment

The deployment infrastructure is complete and ready. The game will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
